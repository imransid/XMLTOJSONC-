The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. However, data may not be recorded depending on the severity and type of a crash.</p><p>The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:</p><list1 type="dot"><list1_item><itemtxt>How various systems in your vehicle were operating;</itemtxt></list1_item><list1_item><itemtxt>How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,</itemtxt></list1_item><list1_item><itemtxt>How fast the vehicle was traveling.</itemtxt></list1_item></list1><p>These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.</p><p>NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.<break />To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.</p><list1 type="bull"><list1_item><itemtxt>Disclosure of the EDR data</itemtxt><itemtxt_sub>Toyota will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except when:</itemtxt_sub><list2 type="dot"><list2_item><itemtxt>An agreement from the vehicle’s owner (or the lessee for a leased vehicle) is obtained</itemtxt></list2_item><list2_item><itemtxt>In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency</itemtxt></list2_item><list2_item><itemtxt>For use by Toyota in a lawsuit</itemtxt></list2_item></list2><itemtxt_sub>However, if necessary, Toyota may:</itemtxt_sub><list2 type="dot"><list2_item><itemtxt>Use the data for research on vehicle safety performance</itemtxt></list2_item><list2_item><itemtxt>Disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing information about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner</itemtxt></list2_item></list2></list1_item></list1></body></introsub><introsub id="in010306"><titlegroup><titlegroupbody><titlegrouprow><titlegroupcell><title>Scrapping of your Toyota</title></titlegroupcell></titlegrouprow></titlegroupbody></titlegroup><body id="in0103060401"><p>The SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your Toyota contain explosive chemicals.
